            <h2 class="story">Hi everyone!</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I would like to talk a little about myself.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I was born in July 1998 in Russia. I don't know anything about my parents because I was adopted when I was 7 months old.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">So, my "adoptive parents" have always been my parents. I owe them everything I have.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">My mom worked in a lawyer office (she retired in 2022) and my dad was an electrical engineer for a big US company.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">As you read in the home page I'm currently working as a Junior Software Developer and you can easily say that my dad passed to me the passion for technology.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">My interest for computers was born a long time ago, in the early 2000s, when I was a little child.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I can remember myself "playing" on a PC with Windows XP installed.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">From that moment I realized that I would like to work with these beautiful, yet complicated, machines.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">Like every children with tech passion, my first dream was to become a videogame developer.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I attended a high school focused a lot on Computer Science and during those summers I worked in an office near home to improve my skills.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">In late 2021 I started working as Junior Software Developer near Milan, in Italy.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I'm focusing a lot on learning Python, Java and C++ better as they are the most used programming languages where I work.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I also have basic knowledge of web programming and database management.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">From now on, I want to expand my knowledge about hardware and low-level programming languages.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I would also like to improve my English listening and speaking skills and I think this job can help a lot with that.</h2>
