            <img class="pic" id="russia" src="media/russia.jpg">
            <h2 class="story">I took my first flight when I was 7 months old. It was the flight to come home.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I was born in Russia in July 1998 and I was adopted by an Italian family in early 1999.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I don't remember anything about Russia but I have an amazing movie that my parents recorded when they come to Russia.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">From that moment, my family and I have always travelled every summer to a different place.</h2>
            <img class="pic" id="berlin" src="media/berlin.jpeg">
            <h2 class="story">My favourite ones have been to go to Balearic Islands (three different islands in three different times), Greece and driving around Umbria.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I also travel a lot with my friends.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">With my female best friend we went to Berlin, near Barcelona and London (we went on a study trip).</h2>

            <h2 class="story">With two of my high school best friends we went to Dublin to celebrate the end of 2022.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">It was one of the best trip I've ever did. We saw almost everything in the city and we never felt tired.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">But, my favourite trip was the one when I went to the USA. Los Angeles and San Francisco!</h2>
            <img class="pic" id="la" src="media/la.jpeg">
            <h2 class="story">It was my first time outside the EU and discovering another world was really exciting.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I'm not planning to go back because I would like to visit other US cities but it certainly worths another trip.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">In my future plan I see my first Asian country: Japan.</h2>
            <h2 class="story">I would like to go there in Spring 2024 with my Dublin friends and other bunch of people.</h2>
